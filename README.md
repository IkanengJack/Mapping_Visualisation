Earthquake Data Visualization - USGS Mapping Project
Overview
This project presents a dynamic and interactive map that visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The visualization showcases critical earthquake information such as depth, magnitude, and location, offering a meaningful and accessible way to explore seismic activity around the world.

The purpose of this project is to support USGS in their mission to deliver timely, relevant, and useful scientific information about natural hazards and the Earth's processes. By translating raw data into a visually engaging format, this tool helps improve public awareness and aids communication with government agencies and environmental stakeholders.

Features
Interactive Map using Leaflet.js

Circle Markers that vary in size and color based on earthquake magnitude and depth

Tooltips that display detailed information including magnitude, depth, and location

Legend that explains the color-coding used for depth levels

Purpose
This tool was created as part of a data visualization challenge to help the USGS build better methods for presenting their seismic data. The visualization not only assists in public education but also strengthens internal and external reporting efforts to secure additional funding and resources for geological research and emergency preparedness.
